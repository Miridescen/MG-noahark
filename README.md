Open the source code and start editing!

## Architecture/Layout
The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container. 

The files/folder structure are a  **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

```
./src/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx       // Main app page
â”œâ”€â”€ abi/          // Contract ABIs from etherscan.io
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/      // Redux actions 
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/       // Static assets (SVGs)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/   // Reusable individual components
â”œâ”€â”€ constants.js/ // Mainnet Addresses & common ABI
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/    // TODO: The contracts be here as submodules
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/      // Helper methods to use in the app
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/        // Shared reactHooks
â”œâ”€â”€ themes/       // Style sheets for dark vs light theme
â””â”€â”€ views/        // Individual Views
```

## Application translation

NoahArk uses [linguijs](https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui) to manage translation.

In order to mark text for translation you can use:
- The <Trans> component in jsx templates eg. `<Trans>Translate me!</Trans>`
- The t function in javascript code and jsx templates. ``` t`Translate me` ```
You can also add comments for the translators. eg.
```
t({
	id: "do_bond",
	comment: "The action of bonding (verb)",
})
```


When new texts are created or existing texts are modified in the application please leave a message in the NoahArkDao app-translation channel for the translators to translate them.

## ðŸš€ Deployment
Auto deployed on [Fleek.co](http://fleek.co/) fronted by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Since it is hosted via IPFS there is no running "server" component and we don't have server sided business logic. Users are served an `index.html` and javascript to run our applications. 

_**TODO**: TheGraph implementation/how/why we use it._
